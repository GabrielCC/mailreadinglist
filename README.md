# mailreadinglist
Simple application to collect links from all the emails in an inbox and populate different services (first one is Pocket).
Use case:
- connect with your pocket account
- the application will provide a random email address
- use this email address to register to a bunch of newsletters (I personally register to a bunch of developer newsletters)
- all emails received will be parsed and the links will be pushed to pocket
